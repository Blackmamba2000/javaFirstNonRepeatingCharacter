firstNonRepeatingCharacter question from CoderFights.

Note: Write a solution that only iterates over the string once and uses O(1) additional memory, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

Given a string s, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

**Example**

 - For s = "abacabad", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.


**Input/Output**

 - [input] String s
 
 - [output] char
   The first non-repeating character in s, or '_' if there are no characters that do not repeat.
